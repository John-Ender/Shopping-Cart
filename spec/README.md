First pass at developing test cases with Jasmine

* **TODOs**: 
    * Code should be refactored to reduce duplication, and improve organization / readability.
    * Test cases require comments beyond failure statements
    * Failure statements should be more descriptive
    * Implement IstanbulJS for code coverage
